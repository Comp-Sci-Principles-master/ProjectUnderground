# ProjectUnderground
Project Underground is a reinterpretation of the classic horror/escape game, occurring on the NYC subway. 

Project Underground was started by the Advanced Computer Science Class at The Kew Forest School. Inspired by the rush hour delays and some quirks of the MTA, our game is the “next level” of your commute (hopefully you never have to encounter this).

The essential tool for creating Project Underground is Unreal Engine 4. Unreal Engine 4 is a game engine that is used in many popular games, including Fortnite and Bioshock. Unreal Engine 4 allows us to create almost everything that the player will see while playing Project Underground whether it be the map, characters, and effects. 

Project Underground is being created for fun but is also to promote our computer science department. We hope Project Underground will expand beyond the walls of our classroom and even our school with the mindset that anyone has the capability to design their own game.
